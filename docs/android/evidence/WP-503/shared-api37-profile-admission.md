# Bounded shared API37 profile admission

This supersedes the procedural CPU/IME blocker, not any historical observation or
acceptance verdict. The user explicitly authorizes bounded runner/profile support
for the already assigned missing API37 cases. No successful API31 case is replayed.

## Provenance and unchanged requirements

The old session `wp503-mainobserver-native.py` requests `-cores 2` and calls
`wp503-prepare-native.py --expected-cpus 2`. The latter accepts **2 or 4**, compares
the requested count with actual `getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`, and labels that
observation `diagnosticProfileOnly=true`. This verifies launch/resource identity;
it is not an assertion in the original cases. The approved plan/manifest, these
case bodies and their shared assertion/harness consumers impose no two-CPU
behavioral precondition. Prior four-CPU comparison results remain separately
qualified diagnostic evidence; they are not credit for this new run.

The preparer unconditionally writes `show_ime_with_hard_keyboard=1` for its broad
fresh-device profile. The selected cases have the following narrower requirements:

| Missing selection | Actual input/IME requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Independent US comparator11 and supplemental tr/az2 | Production target-class invocation and actual Android ICU/API. No Activity, editor, keyboard, CPU-count assertion or timing window. |
| Diagnostics5 | Disconnected CLI has no active terminal input; other cases inspect noise-floor data/scroll and RX filter/status. None requests IME visibility. One original fixture resizes 360x600 and restores 360x900. |
| Nodes7 | Search uses actual semantic text replacement; nickname clicks its real editor and inputs text. All original focus, full-line, scroll, cancellation and target assertions remain. Neither asserts visible IME/insets. Record the actual unmodified IME setting; do not claim keyboard-open coverage. |
| Saved LoS endpoint1 | Actual named actions, role/name layouts, state and callbacks; no editable input or IME visibility assertion. |
| Cached-chat exact-offset/recreation1 | Native editor ACTION_FOCUS and ACTION_SET_TEXT, real saved draft, 12px then24px offset within0.5px, full observed visible-set, actual900/360 recreation. No keyboard-show call, visible-IME assertion or inset predicate. |

The **separate**, unselected
`realCachedChatImeKeepsNativeComposerVisibleAndBackPreservesDraft` explicitly
requires hidden-to-visible IME after a native click, accepting-text state, nonzero
IME inset, composer above the keyboard, and Back hiding it without losing the
draft/navigation. Do not conflate that method with cached-chat restoration. It is
not authorized for replay here. No selected missing case requires a guest setting
write; the new profile truthfully records **IME0**, not IME1 coverage.

The native harness still requires actual API37/font2/RTL/motion0. Every original
48dp, full-line/clipping/ink, callback/selection/status predicate and independent
collation vector remains unchanged. Service activation/restoration and native
window readiness retain1000ms, and instrumentation retains600s. Four CPUs never
extend or excuse those deadlines.

## Source-bound adapter and isolation

`android/accessibility-tests/shared_device_runner.py` admits only existing normal
SDK adb, localhost5037, authorized `emulator-5556`, actual Pixel10/API37/boot1/
bootanim-stopped/4CPUs, actual360x900/mdpi160/font2/motion0/IME0. It never starts,
restarts or stops ADB/emulators; changes auth/keys/settings; clears shared logcat;
or launches an external chooser. It acquires the existing exclusive
`native-execution` hard lock and rejects another actual instrumentation consumer.

Reuse verified retained final composite **3f39a777376e322e2bc533f1d1caf92a87a44ed8**,
Android tree **7a9dd08e005e1e9cad79405dafecf325158d8b0c**, and its original App/Test
APK hashes. Check immutable fixture/product continuity, actual installed APK
digests and runtime profile before each cohort. This is explicit immutable
execution-snapshot binding, **not bypassing current-source acceptance**: the
published owned-only production tree is intentionally different and receives no
native credit from the composite.

Only missing US11/traz2/diagnostics5/Nodes7/LoS1/chat1 are selected, in separate
invocations with exact start/outcome identities; zero, duplicate or mismatched
discovery fails. No new assertions, oracle changes, successful cohort replay or
combined full-suite verdict. The separate historical Nodes search/favorite
negative remains distinct.

Preserve any pre-existing target APK before temporary same-version `install -r`,
verify its bytes and the unchanged exported Room schema identity, never wipe
target data, and restore/read back the original target APK in cleanup. Refuse to
overwrite any existing test package; remove only this adapter's newly installed
test package. Fixture-created data and original temporary window changes retain
their existing cleanup. Surface primary and cleanup failures together.

No CPU changes or IME setting changes are admitted or needed by this adapter.
If a future separately authorized original visible-keyboard case genuinely needs
IME1, snapshot the exact secure key value/presence on this verified endpoint under
the same exclusive lane, set only that key, and in `finally` compare-and-restore
its actual previous value (or delete only this originally absent key), then read
back restoration. Report a concurrent change rather than overwriting it.
That procedure is not executed or validated by this missing-only run.

## Commands

Adapter-only discovery tests (not Android acceptance):

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s android\accessibility-tests -p test_shared_device_runner.py
```

Read-only immutable source/APK/selector check, with retained APK directory:

```powershell
python android\accessibility-tests\shared_device_runner.py --apks <retained-apks> --output <new-owned-capture-directory>
```

The same command with `--execute` runs only the admitted missing27 once. The
output directory must be new; retained positive captures cannot be overwritten.
Results, profile and cleanup must be observed, not inferred from this admission.
WP503 acceptance remains unconfigured; physical TalkBack and protected/human
gates remain separate. Exact f75 hosted800/4FAILED and its two unavailable failure
identities remain unchanged, not rerun to repair missing hosted evidence.
